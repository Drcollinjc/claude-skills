# Skill Evolution Meta-Skill v1.0.0

## Purpose
Manage the evolution of skills based on accumulated lessons

## Evolution Principles
1. **Evidence-Based** - Changes backed by real usage
2. **Incremental** - Small, validated improvements
3. **Backward Compatible** - Don't break what works
4. **Testable** - Each change verifiable

## Pattern Recognition Threshold
After seeing pattern 3+ times across projects:
1. Extract common element
2. Validate across contexts
3. Create skill update
4. Document with examples

## Skill Versioning
```
Major.Minor.Patch
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New patterns/features
- Patch: Bug fixes/clarifications
```

## Update Template
```markdown
## Update: [Date]
### Source
- Projects: [list]
- Pattern: [what was observed]
- Frequency: [how often]

### Change
[Specific addition/modification]

### Rationale
[Why this improves the skill]

### Example
[Concrete example]
```

## Health Metrics
Per skill tracking:
- Usage frequency
- Success rate
- Token efficiency
- Evolution rate
- Last updated

## Anti-Pattern Detection
Watch for:
- Overfitting to single project
- Contradicting patterns
- Increasing complexity without value
- Duplicate knowledge
